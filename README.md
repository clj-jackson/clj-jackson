👋 Hi, I’m Connor Jackson (@clj-jackson) and here is some information about me:

- 👀 I’m interested in game development and software engineering
- ⏰ I have been programming for approximately 3 years majoritively in python, I have some more limited experience in C# for Unity, Flask, javascript, SQL and HTML. I have some work experience in game development.
- 🚁 I'm currently looking into C# for Unity and Flask/django for python

Current projects/goals:

- I'm planning on attempting [Ludum Dare 49](https://ldjam.com/), most likely the Compo version
- I will be hosting my own private Game Jam during December around Christmas time
- I have a discord server dedicated to Game Dev, everyone in it is new to game dev stuff so I'm using it as a platform to encourage others and learn more myself
